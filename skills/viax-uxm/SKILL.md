This skill turns Claude into a competent consumer of `@viax.io/uxm`. It does not generate Vue MFA
apps — for that, use `viax-mfa-component` instead. It assumes the target framework is React 19
(Next.js App Router or Vite SPA) and that `@viax.io/uxm` is or will be a dependency of the project.

## v4.79.0 — current API surface (overrides training data)

The library ships on a fast release train; if your knowledge of it or old code conflicts
with this list, THIS list wins. The sections below cover the **five most recent releases** plus
whatever is merged but unreleased. Everything older — from the 2.0.0 baseline through the
breaking changes in 3.0.0 (`Select` clear button) and 4.0.0 — lives in
`references/changelog.md`, in the same format; read it whenever a consumer is pinned below the
oldest version listed here (check its `package.json`) or a name in old code is not in the
catalog.

### New in 4.76.0

- **Two glyphs, and a keyword is now a name you can render by.** `scroll-text` (a scroll,
  distinct from `document-text`'s page) and `dot-circle-solid` (`dot-circle`'s ring with a
  filled centre, for a live or active state) join the registry. The bigger change is
  `getIcon`: it falls back to a glyph's `keywords` when no id matches, so `<Icon
  glyph="ban" />` draws `no-symbol`, `"send"` draws `paper-airplane`, `"circle-dot"` draws
  `dot-circle`. Most of the registry's keywords resolved to nothing before — `Icon` renders
  `null` on a miss, so they were invisible with no error — including most of the "exists under
  another name" aliases the catalog advertises. **Not all of them**: `log-out` and `archive`
  are advertised but are nobody's keyword, so they still resolve to nothing. An exact id still
  wins, and each keyword belongs to exactly one glyph (pinned by a test), so the fallback is
  single-valued.

  Worth knowing if you pass a **data-driven** name: the keyword set includes ordinary words
  (`error`, `status`, `active`, `live`, `order`, `host`, `notes`), so `glyph={item.status}`
  can now draw a glyph where it drew nothing. Adding a glyph whose **id** equals an existing
  keyword also repoints that alias — `scroll-text` was `document-text`'s keyword before it
  became an id.

### New in 4.77.0

- **`DataTable` rows with `onRowClick` are reachable from the keyboard.** The `<tr>` carried a
  click handler and nothing else — no `tabIndex`, no `onKeyDown`, no focus style — so a row that
  opens a detail pane could only be used with a pointer (**WCAG 2.1.1, Level A**). It now takes
  `tabIndex={0}`, activates on `Enter` / `Space`, and shows a ring from the new
  `--uxm-data-table-row-focus-color` (Studio knob **Row Focus Ring**). A table with no
  `onRowClick` is unchanged and stays out of the tab order. The key has to land on the row
  itself, so `Enter` on a cell's button or editable cell stays that control's; `rowProps`
  composes, with your `onKeyDown` first and `preventDefault()` cancelling the activation, and
  your `tabIndex` overriding the default. **Each row is its own tab stop**, so a long table is a
  long tab sequence; a roving scheme (one stop, arrow keys) is the APG grid answer and is not
  built in — `rowProps` returning `tabIndex: -1` is the hook for one.

- **`DataTable`'s horizontal scroll arrows now appear only when the table can actually scroll.**
  They were keyed off configuration rather than measurement, so *any* `sticky` column mounted two
  permanently inert buttons — and two dead tab stops — over a table that fits. If you assert on
  those buttons, a test against a narrow fixture that no longer overflows will stop finding them.
  At either end of a real scroll both arrows still stay mounted and go `aria-disabled`, unchanged.

### New in 4.77.1

- **A `Tooltip` rendered by a `Popover` now points its arrow at the anchor, not at the middle of
  the bubble.** It was a CSS constant (`left: 50%`), while `HoverTooltip` aligns the panel
  `*-start` — so the arrow missed the trigger's centre by `(panelWidth - anchorWidth) / 2`, and
  `truncatedOnly` means the bubble is wider than its anchor essentially every time it opens. On
  a 182px table cell with a 579px tooltip the arrow sat **199px off, clear of the cell
  entirely**. `Popover` now publishes the anchor's centre relative to the panel, and the arrow
  follows it through the horizontal viewport clamp as well. So this shows up anywhere a
  `HoverTooltip` opens: `DataTable`'s `maxWidth` cells, the `EditableCell` variants that
  truncate (text, date and select — *not* textarea, which has no hover tooltip), and anything
  you wrap in one yourself. The rule is scoped to the panel's **direct child**, so a `Tooltip`
  you position yourself, or one nested deeper inside some other panel, still sits at 50%
  exactly as before; `AppSidebar` passes `showArrow={false}` and is untouched either way. No new
  props and no new public knobs.

### New in 4.78.0

- **`DataTable` can stack into cards at a wider container than 480px.** `stackAt={640 |
  768 | 960}` moves the threshold; `480` stays the default and emits no class, so a table
  that doesn't set it is unchanged. Use it when the table's slot is narrow for its content
  — a side panel, a dashboard column — remembering the measurement is the table's **own
  container**, not the viewport, so the same table can stack in a 600px panel and stay a
  table full-bleed on the same screen. It is a prop, not a CSS knob, because a container
  query cannot read a custom property (the condition parses and then never matches), which
  is also why the accepted values are a closed set.
  Studio exposes it as the Data Table's "Stack Into Cards" layout variant — the only way
  to reach the stacked layout there, since the canvas never narrows to 480px on its own.

### New in 4.79.0

- **A `link` glyph.** Heroicons' chain link, for a "Copy link" action or anything that is a URL —
  until now the nearest was `copy`, which reads as "duplicate". `chain`, `hyperlink`, `url` and
  `permalink` resolve to it as keywords.

### Unreleased

<!-- Notes for changes merged but not yet published. Add a bullet here in the SAME
     PR as the change. At release the pipeline renames this heading to
     "New in X.Y.Z", stamps the version/count markers, and re-opens a fresh
     "### Unreleased" below it (scripts/stamp-skill-version.mjs) — never hand-edit
     the markers, and never append notes under an already-stamped heading. -->

- **A `target` glyph.** House-drawn rings and a centre dot with an arrow landed in it, for
  "reached" or "committed" (e.g. a value committed at a lifecycle step). `bullseye`, `goal`, `aim`,
  `hit` and `commit` resolve to it.

## Workflow

### Where the documentation lives

The library lives at `https://github.com/viax-io/uxm` and publishes as `@viax.io/uxm`
to the public npm registry (`https://registry.npmjs.org`). When a checkout
of that repo is available (search the workspace for a `package.json` with
`"name": "@viax.io/uxm"`), **prefer the per-component READMEs there as the authoritative
reference** (paths relative to the repo root):

- Top-level: `README.md` — install, subpath exports, full component catalog, MODO theming flow,
  architecture diagram.
- Per-component: `src/ui/{component}/README.md` — props table, CSS vars, MODO-configurable
  design tokens, states/variants, accessibility caveats. Every atom has one; the `.tsx` JSDoc
  is the fallback for anything the README does not cover.
- Tokens: `src/tokens/index.ts` — canonical `themeTokens` array.

When no checkout is available (working in a project that only `npm install`s the package), the
installed package still carries `node_modules/@viax.io/uxm/README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and full
`.d.ts` types with the same JSDoc. Beyond that, fall back to the bundled references in this
skill:

- `references/component-catalog.md` — every export, grouped by purpose, with one-line summaries
  and key prop signatures. Use this to pick the right primitive.
- `references/design-tokens.md` — all 31 MODO-configurable design tokens with hex values,
  groups, and intended use. Use this when wiring custom CSS or token-based styling.
- `references/quick-recipes.md` — copy-pasteable patterns for the most common compositions
  (page shell, form, list view, theme override).
- `references/changelog.md` — every "New in X.Y.Z" section older than the five kept in this
  file, including the 3.0.0 / 4.0.0 breaking changes. Read it for consumers pinned to an
  older version or when old code uses a name the catalog no longer has.

### Before writing any code

1. Confirm the project consumes the library **through the `uxm` alias** — the convention every
   viax React app uses:
   ```jsonc
   // package.json
   "dependencies": {
     "uxm": "npm:@viax.io/uxm@^4.40.1"
   }
   ```
   and imports read `from 'uxm/ui'`, `import 'uxm/tokens.css'` — never `@viax.io/uxm/…`.
   - Check `package.json` for the `"uxm": "npm:@viax.io/uxm@…"` entry (and the `react@^19` peer).
   - If the app still lists `"@viax.io/uxm"` directly, switch it to the alias and rewrite the
     imports in the same change — mixing the two forms installs the package twice.
   - If absent and the user wants to add it: `npm i uxm@npm:@viax.io/uxm@latest`. Why the alias:
     short, stable import paths; ONE place to bump the version; and a package rename (it already
     happened once — `@viax/uxm` → `@viax.io/uxm`) never touches application code again.
   - **Check `.npmrc` for a registry override.** If the project's default registry points at
     Nexus (`registry=https://nexus.viax.tech/repository/viax-npm/` — a common viax-internal
     setup) rather than public npm, it MUST also carry
     `@viax.io:registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/`. Nexus mirrors `registry.npmjs.org` with a
     delay, so installing or bumping right after a fresh `@viax.io/uxm` release can 404 or
     silently resolve a stale version through Nexus without this override. Add it if missing —
     see `uxm-studio/.npmrc` for a working example.
2. Confirm CSS imports are in place. Both stylesheets must be imported once at the app entry:
   ```ts
   // app/layout.tsx (Next.js) or main.tsx (Vite/CRA)
   import 'uxm/tokens.css';
   import 'uxm/ui.css';
   ```
   If missing, add them before any visual work.

### Picking the right component

Open `references/component-catalog.md` (or the top-level README if uxm is local) and locate the
category that matches the user's intent. Categories are: **Forms & inputs · Buttons & actions ·
Navigation · Feedback & status · Layout & structure · Data display · Configuration editor ·
Lifecycle diagrams.**

Then read the chosen component's README (per-component, when uxm is local) before writing JSX —
the README documents the prop signature, states, design tokens, and a11y obligations. Do not
guess prop names from training data.

### Writing the JSX

- **Import from the narrowest subpath available** for tree-shaking:
  - `import { ButtonPrimary } from 'uxm/ui'` (preferred) over
    `import { ButtonPrimary } from 'uxm'`.
  - `import { themeTokens } from 'uxm/tokens'` for token-aware tooling.
  - `import { UxmApp } from 'uxm/studio'` + `import 'uxm/studio.css'` to embed the
    live style editor (see "Embedding the style editor").
- **No `"use client"` directive** unless the file uses client-only React features (hooks, state,
  event handlers). UXM components themselves do not require it.
- **BEM classnames are part of the public contract**. If the user wants to extend styling, they
  should target the `uxm-{component}` class or its modifier classes (e.g. `uxm-button-primary`,
  `uxm-chip--state-focus`). Document this when delivering.
- **`className` always merges via the library's `cn` helper internally** — pass any extra class
  freely; it composes with the BEM base class.

### Styling and theming

The library exposes a two-layer customisation model:

| Layer | Where to set | When to use |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| **Component CSS vars** (`--uxm-{component}-*`, incl. per-state `--uxm-{component}-{hover,active,focus,disabled}-*`) | Inline `style`, a scoped CSS rule, or the studio's saved overrides | Per-instance / per-state tweaks (e.g. a specific button's hover background). |
| **Global design tokens** (`--color-*`) | App-level CSS file, or the embedded studio's brand settings | Brand-wide theming. Cascades into every component instantly. |

For any custom colour, **prefer mapping to an existing design token** before introducing a literal
hex. Use `references/design-tokens.md` to find the right token by intent (e.g. "I need a success
green" → `--color-success-text`, not `#166534`).

If the user is building a host shell that lets designers tune the brand live, prefer the
**ready-made editor**: mount `UxmApp` from `uxm/studio` (see "Embedding the style editor").
Only drop down to raw `uxm/previews` (the `PreviewProps` preview primitives) when building a
bespoke editor surface — see `references/quick-recipes.md`.

### Accessibility

Each component README's **Accessibility** section is the authoritative checklist for that
primitive (native semantics it provides, what's missing, ARIA hooks the consumer must wire). Cite
those when delivering work — do not invent your own a11y story without checking.

Some honestly-flagged gaps to know about:
- `data-table` has no `scope` attribute on `<th>`; for sortable / large tables, consumers must
  layer additional ARIA.
- `loader` does not honour `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- `app-sidebar` references `--mobile-*` rules that are missing from its SCSS.
- Several `lifecycle-*` primitives are visual-only and rely on the parent canvas for a11y.

## Embedding the style editor (`uxm/studio`)

The full MODO design workbench ships as a mountable component, so a host portal can offer a live
brand/style editor without rebuilding it. Import it from the `studio` subpath + its CSS once:

```tsx
import { UxmApp, createClientPersistence } from 'uxm/studio';
import 'uxm/studio.css'; // Tailwind v4 bundle — see leakage note below

<UxmApp embed persistence={createClientPersistence({ brand: seed })} />
```

**`UxmApp` props:** `embed` (no full-page chrome — use when mounting inside a host), `persistence`
(the backend contract), `syncFavicon` (drive the tab favicon from the brand).

**Persistence adapters** — pick by whether you have a backend:

- `createHttpPersistence('/api/uxm')` — full read/write/upload against a Hono backend (Save / Quick
  Save / Publish enabled).
- `createClientPersistence({ brand })` — preview-only: live edits + working logo/favicon upload via
  `data:` URLs, nothing saved across reload. For static portals with no backend.
- `createReadOnlyPersistence({ brand })` — live-preview only, uploads disabled.
- For a no-backend portal that still wants **Save-that-persists**, implement the tiny
  `StudioPersistence` interface (`load` / `save` / `uploadAsset` / `capabilities`) over `localStorage`.

**Apply the editor's config to the host globally.** Import `generateOverridesCss` from
`uxm/studio/generate-css`, run it over the saved `{ overrides, brand }`, and inject the result
into a single global `<style>`. It emits the `:root` / `[data-theme="dark"]` brand-token blocks plus
per-component override rules (which the per-state atom CSS now reads), re-theming the whole host on
every route — and survives reload if you persist the state. When the brand carries a typeface
(`brand.fontFamily`, set via Brand Settings → Typography), the same output also includes the
Google-Fonts `@import`, `--brand-font`, and `body { font-family: var(--brand-font) !important }`
— so the host's base font follows the brand automatically. Host CSS should therefore declare its
base font as `html, body, #root { font-family: var(--brand-font, var(--font-sans)); }` and never
hardcode a competing family (see `references/design-tokens.md` → "Typography").

> ⚠️ **A non-Tailwind host must alias `--font-sans` first, or everything renders in Times New
> Roman.** `tokens.css` declares `--font-sans` only inside its `@theme inline { … }` block, a
> Tailwind v4 at-rule that browsers drop wholesale — so the var never actually exists in a plain
> BEM/SCSS host. With no brand font published, `--brand-font` is unset too, so the `body` rule
> above collapses to the guaranteed-invalid value, becomes invalid at computed-value time, and
> `<body>` inherits the browser's default serif. Every uxm atom uses `font-family: inherit`, so the
> serif spreads across the whole app. Add this once, after `tokens.css`:
>
> ```css
> :root { --font-sans: var(--font-inter, 'Inter', system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, sans-serif); }
> button, input, select, textarea { font: inherit; }
> ```
>
> `--font-inter` *is* declared in the real `:root`, so it resolves. The second rule is needed
> because native form controls do NOT inherit the document font (UA default → Arial): uxm atoms
> set `font-family: inherit` themselves, but any raw `<button>`/`<input>`/`<select>` in host code
> would otherwise render in Arial next to the body font. There is no `--font-mono` token —
> use `var(--font-mono, monospace)` with the literal fallback.
>
> These two lines are the emergency fix. **The complete host baseline — including the
> `html, body, #root { height: 100% }` that `PageShell` needs in order to bound its own scroll
> area, and the `DetailSection` / `List` corrections — is
> [`references/quick-recipes.md` § 0](references/quick-recipes.md).** Apply that once and none of
> these come up.

**Brand tokens.** Seed the studio's `brand.tokens.light` / `.dark` with the host's brand colours so
the editor adopts them as its own managed Accent tokens; `BrandTokenStyles` (rendered even in
`embed`) writes them to `:root`, so editing re-tints the host live. The host owns `data-theme`
(light/dark) in `embed` mode — drive it yourself.

**CSS-leakage caveat for non-Tailwind hosts.** `uxm/studio.css` is a Tailwind v4 bundle: a
global preflight reset (`@layer base`, lower priority than your unlayered CSS) plus an UNLAYERED
`:root { … }` block of the library's *default* tokens. In a non-Tailwind host (e.g. a BEM/SCSS
portal), import it **before** the host's own global stylesheet so the host's `:root` brand stays the
base; the studio's runtime `<style>` still wins live on the editor route.

## Hard rules

1. **Never guess prop names.** Always read the component's README (or `component-catalog.md` if
   not available) before writing the JSX.
2. **Never duplicate primitives.** If `@viax.io/uxm` already ships a `Card`, do not handroll a div
   with the same intent. The component count in the heading above is the current catalog size —
   check `references/component-catalog.md` first.
3. **Never inline literal hex codes** when an existing design token covers the intent. Map to
   `--color-*` via `var()` so MODO brand-settings can re-tint.
4. **Never import preview components into application code.** Previews live in
   `uxm/previews` and are for editor/host shells only. Tree-shake guarantees they don't
   leak into `/ui` consumers — keep it that way.
5. **For new components that don't fit any existing primitive**, propose extending the library
   rather than building one-offs. The contribution flow is in the top-level README's
   "Contributing" section.
6. **`PropertyField`'s value is `children`, never a `value` prop.** `value="…"` silently renders
   an empty cell. `PropertyGrid` has no `columns` / `minColumnWidth` prop — its grid template is
   fixed.
7. **`PageHeader`'s `meta` renders inside a `<p>` — inline content only.** A block-level primitive
   (`Stack`, a `<div>`) there is invalid `<div>`-in-`<p>` nesting and triggers a hydration warning.
8. **`ResponsiveGrid`'s `min` is a CSS length string** (`"280px"`), not a bare number — a bare
   number emits an invalid, dropped `minmax()`.
9. **`Stack` is flex-column only — never override it with `flexDirection: 'row'`.** Use `Cluster`
   for horizontal layouts (avatar/name rows, button groups, inline chips).
10. **`BackLink` always needs a real `href`**, even when the click is intercepted for
    client-side nav (`preventDefault()`) — it's an `<a>`, and `onClick`-only breaks keyboard focus
    and right-click/open-in-new-tab.
11. **Import only through the `uxm` alias** (`from 'uxm/ui'`, `import 'uxm/tokens.css'`). Never
    write `@viax.io/uxm/…` in application code — the real package name lives in ONE place, the
    `"uxm": "npm:@viax.io/uxm@^x.y.z"` dependency line, so a version bump or a rename is a one-line
    change. The subpaths are unchanged: `uxm`, `uxm/ui`, `uxm/tokens`, `uxm/hooks`, `uxm/previews`,
    `uxm/studio`, `uxm/studio/generate-css`, plus `uxm/ui.css`, `uxm/tokens.css`, `uxm/studio.css`.

## Out of scope

- **Vue MFA components** — use `viax-mfa-component` skill.
- **A *bespoke* editor surface hand-rolled from raw previews** — `uxm/previews` provides the
  preview primitives for that, but prefer the ready-made `UxmApp` from `uxm/studio`
  ("Embedding the style editor"). Only the bespoke-from-previews path is out of scope here.
- **Design token additions** — propose them via PR to the `@viax.io/uxm` repo, do not invent local
  `--color-*` declarations.
